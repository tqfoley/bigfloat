This project was started in 2009 and first hosted on http://bigfloat.codeplex.com/ where it got over 1,000 downloads.

I moved it to GitHub in January 2016 and if any improvments are done I will make them on GitHub and not on CodePlex.

There is sample code to calculate Pi to ~900 digits and this is the proof of correctness.
